    <h1>The Good Life</h1>


    When some people talk about money <br>
    They speak as if it were a mysterious lover <br>
    Who went out to buy milk and never <br>
    Came back, and it makes me nostalgic <br>
    For the years I lived on coffee and bread, <br>
    Hungry all the time, walking to work on payday <br>
    Like a woman journeying for water <br>
    From a village without a well, then living <br>
    One or two nights like everyone else <br>
    On roast chicken and red wine. </p>
